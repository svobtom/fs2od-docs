Mount on a local computer
=========================

Onedata provides command-line application Oneclient to access stored data mounted on local computer. Your spaces are mounted as directories in specified path. You can work with the date within this folder in a normal POSIX way (you can use commands like ls, cp, â€¦). 

Oneclient can be install on Linux by following command. It can be run on several Linux distro (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS).

-------------------
You can get the access token through the Onedata web interface. Go to the page https://datahub.egi.eu/ozw/onezone/i#/onedata/tokens/new and choose token type by click on the ``Oneclient access``.
